# 👋 Hi, I'm Volkankyc

## 🌐 About Me

I am someone who is interested in the field of **Information Technology**, currently with limited knowledge but a strong desire to learn. **Cloud computing systems** are technologies that we need to integrate into our daily lives—at work, in school, and in every aspect of life.

🎯 My **short-term goal** is to earn the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification. For this reason, I plan to use **GitHub** to manage and practice through personal projects.

I aim to:
- Track my project progress
- Collaborate with others
- Exchange knowledge and ideas to improve myself

In the future, I hope to:
- Contribute to **open-source cloud projects**
- Enrich my portfolio with **real-world applications**

🚀 I believe that combining GitHub with cloud technologies will open the door to exciting opportunities in IT!
